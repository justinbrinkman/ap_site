I am an engineer and math enthusiast. I enjoy learning about programming & statistics and applying
these skills to answer real questions and solve real problems. I especially enjoy playing around with Python 
code and working on interesting software and data projects.

This website was created as a way for me to develop and share my knowledge of Python programming, primarily 
as applied to real-world problems in engineering and statistics. I will also share less practical projects that 
I find intriguing, but I do hope that the more practical content will be of value to others.


I started Apply Python with four main goals:

1. To document and accelerate my progress as an engineer, programmer and data scientist
2. To encourage myself to continue learning about advanced mathematics, natural science and computer science
3. To provide an online resource for others working on similar problems
4. To learn a little bit about web development

Thanks for checking out my website!
