About Me
------------

I am an engineer and data enthusiast. I enjoy learning about programming & statistics and applying
these skills to answer real questions and solve real problems. 

About Apply Python
------------------

This website was developed as a way for me to develop and share my knowledge of Python programming, primarily 
as applied to real-world problems in engineering and statistics. There are many online resources for learning Python, 
but not as many that demonstrate ways for engineers and other working professionals to use Python effectively.  

So, I started Apply Python with three main goals:

1. To learn a little bit about web development
2. To document and accelerate my own progress as a data scientist, programmer and engineer
3. To provide an online resource for others working on similar problems

Thanks for checking out my website!
