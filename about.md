I am an engineer and programming enthusiast. I enjoy playing around with code and working on interesting 
software and data projects. This website was created as a way for me to develop and share my knowledge of 
Python programming, primarily as applied to real-world problem solving techniques and interesting computer 
science topics.


I started Apply Python with four main goals:

1. To document and accelerate my progress as an engineer, programmer and data scientist
2. To encourage myself to continue learning about advanced mathematics, natural science and computer science
3. To provide an online resource for others working on similar problems
4. To learn a little bit about web development

Thanks for checking out my website!
