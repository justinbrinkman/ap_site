About Me
------------

I am an engineer and data enthusiast. I enjoy learning about data science, programming & mathematics and applying
these skills to answer real questions and solve real problems. 

About Apply Python
------------------

This website was developed as a way for me to develop and share my knowledge of Python programming and statistics. 

I started Apply Python with three main goals:

1. To learn a little bit about web development
2. To document and accelerate my progress as a data scientist, programmer and engineer
3. To provide another resource for others working on similar problems

Furthermore, I think it is important to have a healthy dose of skepticism to avoid becoming a [**sheep**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Farm#Other_animals). Evidence-based decision making and conclusion drawing 
is encouraged at Apply Python, and is important for engineers, scientists, businesspeople and laypeople alike.

Thanks for checking out my website!
