Apply Python was created as a way for me to further develop and share my knowledge of Python programming.   

This site is geared towards practical applications of Python (data science, statistics, automation, etc.)
and I hope the information will be valuable to individuals looking to use Python to solve real problems.

Python is a very powerful tool and is a good language to learn regardless of your programming background.  If you are 
interested in making an impact in the workplace or boosting your resume with programming skills for business, then 
Apply Python is the place for you.

Thanks for checking out my website!
