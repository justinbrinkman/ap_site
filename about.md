Apply Python was created as a way for me to further develop and share my knowledge of Python programming.

This site is geared towards practical applications of Python (data science, statistics, automation, etc.) and I hope the information will be valuable to those interested in making an impact in the workplace or boosting their resumes with practical programming skills.

Professionals in engineering, science, business and many other disciplines can benefit from learning Python, though practical computer science skills are often not taught very well in school (ex. engineering graduates can write programs to simulate vending machines but cannot perform routine data analyses). The goal of Apply Python is to fill some of the gaps in practical programming knowledge that is not taught in school or on the job.

Thanks for checking out my website!
