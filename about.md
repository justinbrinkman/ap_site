I am an engineer and data enthusiast. I enjoy learning about programming & statistics and applying
these skills to answer real questions and solve real problems. 

This website was created as a way for me to develop and share my knowledge of Python programming, primarily 
as applied to real-world problems in engineering and statistics. I will also explore interesting (but maybe less 
practical for the working professional) topics in math and engineering computation.

I started Apply Python with four main goals:

1. To document and accelerate my own progress as an engineer, programmer and data scientist
2. To encourage myself to continue learning about advanced mathematics, natural science and computer science
3. To provide an online resource for others interested in similar problems and topics, primarily for those without 
a formal education in CS or software engineering
4. To learn a little bit about web development

Thanks for checking out my website!
